Welcome to the **React Games**! This project is a collection of two games: **Tic Tac Toe** and **Guess the Color**. It showcases my skills in web development and React programming.

## Games Details

### Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game. Players take turns marking a square with either 'X' or 'O'. The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

### Guess the Color

Guess the Color is a simple game where you need to guess the correct color displayed on the board from a set of three random colors in hexadecimal. If you guess correctly, you win and can start a new game.
